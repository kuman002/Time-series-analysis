# Time Series Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive workflow for time series data analysis and forecasting using statistical and machine learning models.

## üîç Activities Performed

### 1. Data Collection & Loading
- Importing datasets from various sources (CSV/API).
- Time index formatting and datetime parsing.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values.
- Smoothing, resampling, and differencing.
- Normalization and outlier treatment.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of time-series components (trend, seasonality, residuals).
- Stationarity checks using ADF and KPSS tests.
- ACF and PACF plots for lag analysis.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Generating lag features and rolling window statistics.
- Time-based features (day, week, month, etc.).
- Seasonal decomposition.

### 5. Modeling
- **Classical models**: ARIMA, SARIMA.
- **Deep learning models**: LSTM.
- **Tool**: Facebook Prophet
- Model tuning using grid search or auto-selection (e.g., `pmdarima.auto_arima`).

### 6. Forecasting
- Out-of-sample forecasting.
- Multi-step and recursive forecasting strategies.

### 7. Evaluation
- Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE.
- Residual analysis and diagnostics.
- Visual comparison of predicted vs. actual values.

### 8. Visualization
- Forecast plots.
- Component decomposition plots.
- Residual distribution and error tracking.

### 9. Documentation
- Step-by-step experimentation in Jupyter Notebooks.
- Code modularized into reusable Python scripts.
